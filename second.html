        Q2: Can I use multiple CSS Background images in a div? Explain with an example.</h1>
    <div class="multiple-bg"></div>
    <p></p>
        Yes, you can use multiple CSS background images in a div. This example demonstrates two images, each with its own position and size. The first image is centered and has a size of 100px by 100px, while the second image is placed top-left with a size of 200px by 200px. The border around the div is also visible to demonstrate the added styling.
